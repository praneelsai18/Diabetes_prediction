# Mini Project 1 — Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This mini project builds a diabetes prediction model using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.  
The model is trained and evaluated using Logistic Regression and saved for future predictions.

## Files in this repository
- `mini_project_1_diabetes_prediction.zip` — Full project archive (contains `main.py`, `diabetes.csv`, and saved `model/` files).
- `main.py` — Training and evaluation script (in archive).
- `requirements.txt` — Python libraries required (in archive).
- `model/` — Saved model and preprocessing objects (inside the archive).

> **Note:** Download and extract the ZIP to run the project locally.

## How to run (after unzipping)
1. Install Python (3.8 or above).  
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script trains a Logistic Regression model, evaluates it on a test set (prints accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report), saves the trained model under `model/`, and demonstrates a sample prediction.

## Results
Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are printed after training. Example results should be visible in the program output when you run `main.py`.
